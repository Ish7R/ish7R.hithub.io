"I have never been too comfortable with the past, the passage of time, or even the concept of it."

"I do not enjoy remembering lessons or reliving my happiest memories.
It is there but it is gone,
and it will never come back againâ€”
but it is right there, cutting,
searing through your veins."

'The B sound:'
'My headphones won't drown it,
they are the noise
banging against my brain
endlessly.
Everything is wrong,
(Everything you do is wrong)'

'I swear I never sold my soul, then why can't I get out?'

'I want my heart,
to want it,
as bad as I do.'

'I am surrounded by plants,
I am, by definition, part of an ecosystem.'

'Whatever.'

'There is a woman, a woman I love above myself and religion,
if only I did not fear God or her well-being,
I could love her above it too.'

'We are everything,
Us,
We are nothing.'
