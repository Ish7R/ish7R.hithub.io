My darling, my iridescent pearl;
the exciting feeling of loving a girl.

You’re my hope and love, and you’re so beautiful.

You're going to d*e in your best friend's arms.
And you play along because it's funny,
because it's written down, you've memorized it,
it's all you know.

And there you were.
In molecules arranged so terrifying and beautiful,
I thought you walked straight out of my dreams.
It stops my heart, still.

I miss you even more than I could have believed;
and I was prepared to miss you a good deal.
So this letter is just really a squeal of pain.
It is incredible how essential to me you have become.

We’re just gonna fucking fight.
Because you’re it, okay?
I’m never gonna love anybody in the world like I love you.
So, I promise you, one day we’ll be able to just be,
and fuck everyone else.

My most devoted companion,
faithful, persistent.
The sadness rolled in and remains eternal.
Gray-hued and textureless,
dulling sight and sound,
wrenching spirit from body,
breath from lungs,
me from me.

Tu voz llenándome de lágrimas...

You linger in my sacred space.
