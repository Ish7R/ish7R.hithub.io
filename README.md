This is meant to be the repository for a p5.js project where I build a background and elements usingp p5 functions and it will show stanzas originally written by me (rita_me). using RiTa.js the stanzas are then tokenized and edited into many more verses. 

Update October 2, 2024. This project is finished-- you can run this program and be amazed! Good luck out there, amigo.
